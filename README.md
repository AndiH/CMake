# CMake Examples
For my PhD project I need to run GPU code out of our experiment's ROOT installation. That's not that easy.
But it's possible, yay!

This repo has examples of increasing complexity on how to use CMake.

The examples are:

 * Plain C++ library
 * C++ and CUDA combined
 * C++, CUDA, and ROOT / PandaRoot combined
 
See subdirectories for detailed descriptions.
